## Migration Plans
This project is transitioning from a Supabase/serverless backend to a traditional, self-hosted backend. The migration is organized into three main tracks:

- **[Backend Migration Plan](./backend.md):**
  - API, database, features, and integration
- **[Frontend Migration Plan](./frontend.md):**
  - API integration, refactoring, and testing
- **[DevOps Migration Plan](./devops.md):**
  - Infrastructure, CI/CD, deployment, and monitoring

Each plan includes a detailed week-by-week timeline and deliverables.

---

## Team Guides
To ensure project success, each team has a dedicated success guide:

- **[Backend Success Guide](./backend-success-guide.md):**
  - Responsibilities, best practices, and critical steps for backend developers
- **[Frontend Success Guide](./frontend-success-guide.md):**
  - Responsibilities, best practices, and critical steps for frontend developers
- **[DevOps Success Guide](./devops-success-guide.md):**
