# Security Checklist for PHCityRent

## üîí Environment Variables Security

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] `.env` file removed from Git tracking
- [x] `.env` and related files added to `.gitignore`
- [x] `.env.example` created with placeholder values
- [x] `.env.local.example` created for local development
- [x] Documentation created for environment setup

### üîç Verification Steps

1. **Check Git Status:**
   ```bash
   git status
   # Should NOT show .env files as tracked
   ```

2. **Verify .gitignore:**
   ```bash
   git check-ignore .env .env.local .env.production.local
   # Should return the filenames (meaning they're ignored)
   ```

3. **Check Git History:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --grep="Remove .env"
   # Should show the commit removing .env from tracking
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- [ ] Use test/sandbox keys for development
- [ ] Use separate keys for staging and production
- [ ] Rotate production keys regularly (quarterly)
- [ ] Never log environment variables
- [ ] Use least-privilege principle for API keys

### Database Security
- [ ] Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- [ ] Use proper authentication for database access
- [ ] Regularly audit database permissions
- [ ] Enable database logging for production

### API Security
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production
- [ ] Validate all input data
- [ ] Implement proper error handling (don't expose sensitive info)
- [ ] Use CORS properly

### Payment Security
- [ ] Use PCI-compliant payment processors
- [ ] Never store credit card information
- [ ] Implement proper webhook verification
- [ ] Use test keys for development/testing
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious transactions

## üö® Security Incidents

### If Environment Variables Are Exposed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - [ ] Rotate all exposed API keys immediately
   - [ ] Check logs for unauthorized access
   - [ ] Notify relevant service providers
   - [ ] Document the incident

2. **Investigation:**
   - [ ] Determine how the exposure occurred
   - [ ] Check what data might have been accessed
   - [ ] Review access logs
   - [ ] Assess impact on users

3. **Recovery:**
   - [ ] Update all affected systems with new keys
   - [ ] Test all integrations with new keys
   - [ ] Monitor for any issues
   - [ ] Update security procedures

## üìã Regular Security Audits

### Monthly
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Check for unused API keys
- [ ] Verify environment variable security
- [ ] Review user permissions

### Quarterly
- [ ] Rotate production API keys
- [ ] Security penetration testing
- [ ] Review and update security policies
- [ ] Audit third-party integrations

### Annually
- [ ] Comprehensive security audit
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Security training for team
- [ ] Review compliance requirements

## üîß Tools and Monitoring

### Recommended Tools
- [ ] Git-secrets for preventing secret commits
- [ ] Dependabot for dependency security
- [ ] Snyk for vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Sentry for error monitoring

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Monitor API usage patterns
- [ ] Track payment transaction anomalies
- [ ] Set up database access monitoring
