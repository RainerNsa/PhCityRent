# Backend Success Guide

## Introduction
This guide provides backend developers with a comprehensive checklist, best practices, and detailed instructions to ensure the successful migration and implementation of the backend for this real estate platform. It covers architecture, coding standards, security, integration, and operational excellence.

---

## 1. Project Understanding & Goals
- Understand the business domain: real estate property search, management, and transactions.
- Review the frontend requirements and API contract.
- Ensure all features from the previous Supabase/serverless backend are replicated or improved.

---

## 2. Architecture & Technology Choices
- Use Node.js (Express or NestJS recommended) with TypeScript for maintainability.
- PostgreSQL as the primary database (self-hosted or managed).
- JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.
- File storage: local disk for dev, S3-compatible for production.
- Real-time: WebSockets (Socket.IO) for messaging/notifications.
- Email/SMS: Integrate with providers (SendGrid, Mailgun, Twilio).

---

## 3. Development Responsibilities
### A. Project Setup
- Initialize the backend project with TypeScript, linting, and formatting.
- Set up environment variable management and secure secrets handling.

### B. Database
- Apply and maintain schema migrations (use tools like Knex, TypeORM, or Sequelize).
- Ensure data integrity and proper indexing for performance.
- Migrate all data from Supabase, including users, properties, messages, etc.

### C. API Implementation
- Build RESTful (or GraphQL) endpoints for all features:
  - Authentication (register, login, password reset, JWT issuance)
  - User management (roles, permissions)
  - Property CRUD, search, and filtering
  - Messaging and notifications
  - Payments and escrow
  - File uploads/downloads
- Implement input validation and error handling for all endpoints.
- Write clear, versioned API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger).

### D. Security
- Use HTTPS everywhere (enforced by reverse proxy).
- Sanitize and validate all user input.
- Secure JWT handling and session management.
- Implement rate limiting and brute-force protection.
- Secure file upload endpoints (file type/size checks, virus scanning if possible).

### E. Real-time Features
- Implement WebSocket server for real-time messaging and notifications.
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization for socket connections.

### F. Testing
- Write unit and integration tests for all endpoints and business logic.
- Use test databases and mock services for isolated testing.

### G. Performance & Optimization
- Optimize database queries and API response times.
- Use caching where appropriate (Redis, in-memory, etc.).
- Profile and monitor API performance.

### H. Documentation & Collaboration
- Maintain up-to-date API documentation for frontend and QA teams.
- Communicate changes and blockers early.
- Participate in code reviews and follow team conventions.

---

## 4. Deployment & Operations
- Ensure the backend is containerized (Docker) for consistent deployment.
- Work with DevOps to set up CI/CD pipelines, environment configs, and secrets.
- Prepare and test database backup/restore procedures.
- Monitor logs, errors, and performance metrics in production.
- Respond to incidents and participate in post-mortems.

---

## 5. Success Criteria
- All features are implemented, tested, and documented.
- Data is migrated and accessible.
- API is stable, secure, and performant.
- Backend is production-ready and maintainable.

---

## 6. Additional Tips
- Keep code modular and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Use environment variables for all secrets and config.
- Regularly sync with frontend and DevOps teams.
- Stay up to date with security patches and dependencies.
