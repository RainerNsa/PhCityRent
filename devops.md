# DevOps Migration Plan

## Overview
This document details the DevOps plan for migrating from a serverless/Supabase backend to a self-hosted backend, including infrastructure, CI/CD, deployment, and monitoring. It provides a week-by-week timeline for DevOps deliverables.

**For an in-depth guide on DevOps responsibilities and best practices for this project, see: [DevOps Success Guide](./devops-success-guide.md)**

---

## Technology Stack
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **Reverse Proxy:** Nginx or Traefik
- **Process Management:** PM2 or systemd
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (self-hosted or managed)
- **Storage:** S3-compatible or local disk

---

## Migration Steps & Weekly Timeline

### **Week 1: Infrastructure Planning & Setup**
- Choose hosting provider (cloud VM, on-prem, etc.)
- Provision server(s) for backend and database
- Set up PostgreSQL instance
- Set up S3-compatible storage (if needed)
- Set up DNS and SSL certificates

### **Week 2: Containerization & Reverse Proxy**
- Dockerize backend application
- Write Docker Compose files for backend, DB, and storage
- Set up Nginx/Traefik as reverse proxy with HTTPS
- Configure firewall and security groups

### **Week 3: CI/CD Pipeline**
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for build, test, and deploy (GitHub Actions, etc.)
- Automate Docker image builds and pushes
- Automate database migrations on deploy
- Set up environment variable management

### **Week 4: Monitoring & Logging**
- Set up application and server monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Set up error tracking (Sentry)
- Configure centralized logging (ELK stack or similar)
- Set up alerting for critical issues

### **Week 5: Backup, Scaling & Security**
- Set up automated database and file backups
- Test restore procedures
- Implement auto-scaling or load balancing (if needed)
- Harden server security (fail2ban, SSH, etc.)

### **Week 6: Production Readiness & Handover**
- Finalize deployment scripts and documentation
- Conduct load and failover testing
- Handover to operations/support team
- Monitor post-launch and address issues

## Success Criteria
- Backend and database are reliably hosted and accessible
- CI/CD automates build, test, and deploy
- Monitoring and alerting are in place
- Backups and security are robust
- System is production-ready
