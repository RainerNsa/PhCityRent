# Frontend Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for updating the frontend to integrate with the new traditional backend, replacing Supabase SDK calls with REST/GraphQL API calls, and ensuring a smooth migration. Includes a week-by-week timeline for frontend deliverables.

**For an in-depth guide on frontend developer responsibilities and best practices for this project, see: [Frontend Success Guide](./frontend-success-guide.md)**

## Migration Steps & Weekly Timeline

### **Week 1: Planning & API Contract Alignment**
- Review new backend API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Identify all Supabase SDK usages in the codebase
- Plan refactoring for each feature (auth, properties, messaging, etc.)

### **Week 2: Auth & User Management Refactor**
- Replace Supabase auth calls with new backend endpoints
- Update login, registration, and session management logic
- Test user flows (login, logout, registration, password reset)

### **Week 3: Property & Search Integration**
- Refactor property listing, search, and detail pages to use new API
- Update hooks (e.g., useProperties) to fetch from backend
- Test filtering, sorting, and pagination

### **Week 4: Messaging, Notifications & Real-time**
- Update messaging and notification features to use backend endpoints
- Integrate with WebSocket/real-time API for live updates
- Test message sending, receiving, and notification delivery

### **Week 5: File Uploads, Payments & Edge Cases**
- Refactor file upload components to use backend endpoints
- Update payment flows to use new backend
- Test all edge cases and error handling

### **Week 6: QA, Bugfixes & Launch**
- Conduct end-to-end testing across all features
- Fix bugs and polish UI/UX
- Coordinate with backend and DevOps for launch
- Monitor post-launch and address issues
